# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with the Sleeper Fantasy Football API to provide Claude Desktop users with access to fantasy football data and functionality. The server will act as a bridge between Claude and Sleeper's comprehensive fantasy sports platform, enabling users to query league information, player data, matchups, and other fantasy football insights through natural language interactions.

The MCP server will be designed for compatibility with Claude Desktop's MCP framework, providing reliable access to Sleeper's REST API endpoints while maintaining proper error handling and data formatting for optimal user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fantasy football player, I want to query my Sleeper leagues through Claude Desktop, so that I can get quick insights about my teams and leagues without switching applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests league information THEN the system SHALL retrieve and display league details including name, settings, roster positions, and scoring configuration
2. WHEN a user provides a league ID THEN the system SHALL fetch all teams/rosters in that league with owner information
3. WHEN a user requests their leagues THEN the system SHALL retrieve all leagues for a given username
4. IF a league ID is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating the league was not found

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a fantasy football manager, I want to access player information and statistics through Claude, so that I can make informed decisions about my roster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for a player THEN the system SHALL return player details including position, team, and current season stats
2. WHEN a user requests trending players THEN the system SHALL fetch the most added/dropped players with trend data
3. WHEN a user asks for player projections THEN the system SHALL retrieve available projection data for specified players
4. WHEN a user requests trade analysis THEN the system SHALL analyze other rosters in the league to identify potential trade matches based on positional needs and player values
5. WHEN a user asks for roster analysis THEN the system SHALL evaluate team strengths and weaknesses across all roster positions
6. IF a player name is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL return multiple matching players for user clarification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a league participant, I want to view matchup information and scores through Claude, so that I can track game progress and results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests current week matchups THEN the system SHALL display all matchups for the specified league and week
2. WHEN a user asks for matchup scores THEN the system SHALL show current points for each team in active matchups
3. WHEN a user requests historical matchups THEN the system SHALL retrieve results from previous weeks
4. IF no matchups exist for a requested week THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the week is not available

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an MCP server administrator, I want the server to handle authentication and rate limiting properly, so that it maintains reliable access to the Sleeper API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server makes API requests THEN it SHALL respect Sleeper's rate limiting guidelines
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
3. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately and return user-friendly messages
4. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL validate its configuration and connectivity to Sleeper API

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Claude Desktop user, I want the MCP server to integrate seamlessly with my Claude configuration, so that I can access Sleeper data through natural language queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is configured THEN it SHALL register all available tools with Claude Desktop
2. WHEN a user makes a query THEN the system SHALL parse the request and call appropriate Sleeper API endpoints
3. WHEN data is returned THEN the system SHALL format responses in a readable way for Claude to present
4. IF the server is unavailable THEN Claude SHALL receive appropriate error messages indicating the service status

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to be built with a reliable technology stack, so that it provides consistent performance and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN choosing the implementation language THEN the system SHALL prioritize compatibility with MCP standards, ease of deployment, and community support
2. WHEN handling HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL implement proper timeout and error handling
3. WHEN processing API responses THEN the system SHALL validate data structure and handle malformed responses gracefully
