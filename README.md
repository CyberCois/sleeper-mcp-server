## API Rate Limiting and Caching

### Rate Limiting

The server implements intelligent rate limiting to respect Sleeper API guidelines:

- **Rate Limit**: Follows Sleeper's documented rate limits
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s) for rate-limited requests
- **Queue Management**: Requests are queued during rate limit periods
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages when rate limits are encountered

### Caching Strategy

Different data types have optimized cache TTL values:

| Data Type | Cache TTL | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Player Data | 1 hour | Relatively static during season |
| League Settings | 24 hours | Rarely change mid-season |
| Draft Data | 24 hours | Historical data, doesn't change |
| Matchup Data (active) | 5 minutes | Real-time scoring updates |
| Matchup Data (completed) | 1 hour | Historical data is stable |
| Trending Players | 30 minutes | Updated frequently |
| Roster Data | 15 minutes | Changes with transactions |
| Roster Data (with draft) | 15 minutes | Changes with transactions |

**Cache Features:**
- In-memory caching for optimal performance
- TTL-based expiration
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Cache hit/miss logging for monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Server Won't Start

**Symptoms:**
- Claude Desktop shows "Server unavailable" error
- No response from MCP tools

**Solutions:**
- Verify Python installation: `python --version` (should be 3.8+)
- Check package installation: `pip show sleeper-mcp-server`
- Verify Claude Desktop configuration syntax
- Check logs for specific error messages

#### 2. Authentication/API Errors

**Symptoms:**
- "API request failed" errors
- "Invalid league ID" messages

**Solutions:**
- Verify league IDs are correct (18-character strings)
- Check username spelling and case sensitivity
- Ensure Sleeper API is accessible from your network
- Try again after a few minutes (may be temporary API issues)

#### 3. Rate Limiting Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "Rate limit exceeded" messages
- Slow response times
- "Please wait" messages

**Solutions:**
- Wait for the specified retry period
- Reduce frequency of requests
- Use cached data when possible
- Check if multiple instances are running

#### 4. Cache Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Stale data being returned
- Inconsistent results

**Solutions:**
- Restart the MCP server to clear cache
- Adjust `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` environment variable
- Check system memory availability

#### 5. Configuration Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Tools not appearing in Claude Desktop
- Environment variables not working

**Solutions:**
- Validate JSON syntax in Claude Desktop config
- Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
- Check file permissions on config file
- Verify environment variable names and values

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sleeper": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "sleeper_mcp_server"],
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "DEBUG"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Logs**: Enable DEBUG logging to see detailed error information
2. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure Claude Desktop MCP configuration is correct
3. **Test API Access**: Verify you can access Sleeper API directly
4. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all packages are up to date
5. **Restart Services**: Try restarting both the MCP server and Claude Desktop

### Performance Optimization

#### For Large Leagues
- Use position filtering in player searches
- Cache frequently accessed league data
- Limit historical matchup queries

#### For Multiple Leagues
- Batch similar requests when possible
- Use appropriate cache TTL settings
- Monitor rate limit usage
